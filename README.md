# React Template

## Important Notice

**Strongly recommended to use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install the recommended extensions for the best development experience.**  
_If you do not use VSCode and the recommended extensions, you will not be able to automatically fix errors on save and use Prettier for automatic formatting._
